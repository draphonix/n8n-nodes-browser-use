## Credentials

### Browser Use Cloud API

To use the Browser Use Cloud API, you need to obtain an API key:

1. Sign up for Browser Use at [Browser Use Cloud](https://cloud.browser-use.com)
2. Navigate to the billing section to find your API key
3. Create a new credential of type "Browser Use Cloud API" in n8n
4. Enter your API key in the credential configuration

The node automatically validates your API key by sending a ping request to the Browser Use Cloud API. If the API key is invalid or the service is unavailable, you'll receive a clear error message.

### Browser Use Local Bridge API (üöß Work In Progress)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note: The Local Bridge feature is currently under development and may not be fully functional.**

To use the Local Bridge connection:

1. Set up the Browser Use bridge service (documentation coming soon)
2. Create a new credential of type "Browser Use Local Bridge API" in n8n
3. Configure with:
   - URL of your local bridge service (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
   - Authentication token (if enabled)

## Compatibility

This node has been tested with n8n version 1.80.4.

The Nodes-as-Tools feature requires n8n version 1.62.1 or newer.

## Usage

### Cloud API Connection

1. Add the Browser Use node to your workflow
2. Select "Cloud API" as the connection type
3. Choose your credentials or create new ones
4. Select an operation (Run Task, Get Task Status, etc.)
5. Configure the operation parameters
6. Run your workflow

### Local Bridge Connection (üöß Work In Progress)

The Local Bridge option allows you to connect to a locally running Browser Use instance, which can be useful for development, testing, or when you need to keep your automation entirely on-premise.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Setup Requirements (Coming Soon):**

1. Clone the repository for the bridge service (under development)
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the bridge service

Then in n8n:

1. Add the Browser Use node to your workflow
2. Select "Local Bridge" as the connection type
3. Choose your credentials or create new ones
4. Configure as you would with the Cloud API connection

## Nodes-as-Tools

Starting with version 0.1.4, Browser Use node supports the n8n Nodes-as-Tools feature, allowing it to be used directly by AI agents in your workflows.

### Requirements

- n8n version 1.62.1 or newer
- AI Agent node in your workflow

### Using Browser Use as an AI Tool

1. Add the Browser Use node to your workflow
2. Configure the node with your credentials
3. Connect it to an AI Agent node
4. The AI Agent can now use Browser Use operations based on natural language instructions

### Configuration for Community Nodes

Since Browser Use is a community node, you'll need to enable community packages as tools:

1. Set the environment variable `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true` when running n8n
2. Restart your n8n instance

Example for a Docker-based installation:
```bash
docker run -e N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
```

### Example Prompts for AI Agents

Here are some examples of how to instruct an AI agent to use Browser Use:

- "Go to amazon.com and extract the prices and ratings of the top 5 bestsellers in electronics"
- "Navigate to my company's website, log in with my credentials, and download the latest financial report"
- "Search for recent news about artificial intelligence and summarize the top 3 articles"
- "Fill out a contact form on example.com with my information"

### Tool Operations Available to AI

The AI agent can use all of the Browser Use operations:

- **Run Task**: Execute browser automation with natural language instructions
- **Get Task Status**: Check if a task is completed or still running
- **Get Task**: Retrieve detailed information about a task
- **Get Task Media**: Obtain screenshots, videos, or PDFs from a task
- **Pause/Resume/Stop Task**: Control running tasks
- **List Tasks**: View all browser automation tasks
